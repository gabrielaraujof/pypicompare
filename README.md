# Pypicompare

This project is inspired on the great web tool [NPMCompare](https://npmcompare.com/) and based on the [PyPI API](https://pypi.python.org/pypi).

Its main goal is to provide an easy and quickly way to compare python packages by way of its characteristics and overall popularity in the python community.

## Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:5100/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Disclaimer

The project has no association with neither NPMCompare or PyPI.
